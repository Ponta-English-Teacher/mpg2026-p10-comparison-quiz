  // ── Section 1: Multiple Choice ───────────────────────────────

  {
    id: 1, section: 1, type: "mc",
    stem: "The researcher _____ conducted the survey presented the results.",
    options: {
      A: "whom",
      B: "who",
      C: "whose",
      D: "where",
    },
    correct: "B",
    explanation: "The relative pronoun is the subject of 'conducted' — the researcher conducted the survey. Use 'who' for a person in subject position. 'Whom' is the object form ('the researcher whom I interviewed').",
  },
  {
    id: 2, section: 1, type: "mc",
    stem: "The article _____ I read yesterday was highly informative.",
    options: {
      A: "who",
      B: "which",
      C: "where",
      D: "whose",
    },
    correct: "B",
    explanation: "An article is a thing — use 'which' or 'that.' The article is the object of 'read,' so 'that' or zero (no pronoun) would also be possible in natural English. 'Who' and 'whose' are for people. 'Where' is for places.",
  },
  {
    id: 3, section: 1, type: "mc",
    stem: "The student _____ research proposal was approved will begin collecting data next month.",
    options: {
      A: "who",
      B: "whom",
      C: "whose",
      D: "which",
    },
    correct: "C",
    explanation: "'Whose' shows possession: 'the student's research proposal was approved.' Use 'whose' when the noun that follows belongs to the antecedent.",
  },
  {
    id: 4, section: 1, type: "mc",
    stem: "The university _____ I studied has an excellent library.",
    options: {
      A: "where",
      B: "when",
      C: "why",
      D: "whose",
    },
    correct: "A",
    explanation: "We study AT a university — the university is a location. Use 'where': 'the university where I studied.' Compare Q5: 'the university which I visited' — visited takes a direct object, so use 'which' or 'that' there.",
  },
  {
    id: 5, section: 1, type: "mc",
    stem: "The university _____ I visited last year has an excellent library.",
    options: {
      A: "where",
      B: "when",
      C: "which",
      D: "whose",
    },
    correct: "C",
    explanation: "'I visited the university' — the university is the direct object of 'visited.' Use 'which' or 'that.' 'Where' is not correct here because the university is the object, not the location of the visiting.",
  },
  {
    id: 6, section: 1, type: "mc",
    stem: "The year _____ I entered university was 2023.",
    options: {
      A: "where",
      B: "when",
      C: "why",
      D: "whose",
    },
    correct: "B",
    explanation: "'The year' is a time expression. Use 'when' for time nouns: 'the year when I entered university.' 'Where' is for places. 'Why' is for reasons.",
  },
  {
    id: 7, section: 1, type: "mc",
    stem: "The reason _____ many students choose this program is its international focus.",
    options: {
      A: "where",
      B: "when",
      C: "why",
      D: "whose",
    },
    correct: "C",
    explanation: "After 'reason,' use 'why': 'the reason why many students choose this program.' 'Why' introduces the cause or reason. 'Where' is for places. 'When' is for time.",
  },
  {
    id: 8, section: 1, type: "mc",
    stem: "Professor Tanaka, _____ teaches sociolinguistics, gave the keynote speech.",
    options: {
      A: "who",
      B: "that",
      C: "whom",
      D: "where",
    },
    correct: "A",
    explanation: "Professor Tanaka is already identified by name, so the clause adds information — commas are used. With commas, use 'who' for a person. 'That' is never used in a clause with commas. 'Whom' is the object form, but here the pronoun is the subject of 'teaches.'",
  },
  {
  id: 9,
  section: 1,
  type: "mc",
  stem: "The researcher with _____ I worked on the project moved to Saudi Arabia.",
  options: {
    A: "whom",
    B: "that",
    C: "which",
    D: "where",
  },
  correct: "A",
  explanation: "After a preposition such as 'with,' formal English uses 'whom': 'the researcher with whom I worked.' In everyday conversation, native speakers often avoid this structure and say 'the researcher who I worked with' or simply 'the researcher I worked with.' However, when the preposition comes before the relative pronoun, 'whom' is the standard answer.",
},
{
  id: 10, section: 1, type: "mc",
    stem: "The proposal _____ the committee rejected generated considerable discussion.",
    options: {
      A: "which",
      B: "whose",
      C: "where",
      D: "why",
    },
    correct: "A",
    explanation: "The proposal is the object of 'rejected.' Use 'which' or 'that' for a thing in object position. 'Whose' shows possession. 'Where' and 'why' are relative adverbs for places and reasons.",
  },
